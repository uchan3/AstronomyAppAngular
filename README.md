# AstronomyApp

This is the user interface for the Astronomy Application. Angular is used for creating the user interface. The idea behind this application is to enable users to share and comment on posts regarding astronomical objects (like nebulas, galaxies,planets). 

Current features I have in mind as I am updating the README.md file: 
1. Move the ASP.NET Web API repository to another repository. This repository is meant to be focused on the user interface, nothing else! 
2. Research on how to do testing for user interface. 
3. Re-organize the components/services within this application. 
4. Potentially connect ASP.NET Web API to this user interface. 

In the future, I would like to work on the following:
1. Creating a Dockerfile for the app. 
2. Build out the pipeline to validate build of the app.
